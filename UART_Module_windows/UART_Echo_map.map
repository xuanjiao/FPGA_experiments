Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    83 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  83
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         89 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       89 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              83
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                    5
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    41 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          110
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            27 out of     110   24%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  21 out of     110   19%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          62 out of     110   56%
    Number of unique control sets:              17
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              37 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         4 out of     480    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        4 out of       4  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.16

Peak Memory Usage:  321 MB
