Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   220 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 220
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        249 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      249 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             177
      Number using O5 output only:               3
      Number using O5 and O6:                   69
  Number of route-thrus:                         3
    Number using O6 output only:                 3

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    90 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          293
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            73 out of     293   24%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  44 out of     293   15%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         176 out of     293   60%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        17 out of     480    3%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       17 out of      17  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.86
