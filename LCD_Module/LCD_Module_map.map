Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    84 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  84
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        128 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      125 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              86
      Number using O5 output only:              36
      Number using O5 and O6:                    3
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         3
  Number of route-thrus:                        39
    Number using O6 output only:                39

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    47 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          140
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            56 out of     140   40%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  12 out of     140    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          72 out of     140   51%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        23 out of     480    4%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       23 out of      23  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.39
