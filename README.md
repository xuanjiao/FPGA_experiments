# FPGA experiments

In FPGA experiments I have programmed solutions with Verilog hardware Description language and test them on an FPGA board 
Contents of individual experiment modules:

1. Development of a clock divider
2. Control of a seven-segment display
3. Control of an LCD module
4. Development of a UART module
5. Development of an SPI controller and activation of an acceleration sensor
